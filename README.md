Project Repository for SunHacks'20

# Aim
Our project aims to not leave anyone out from resources which are available on the internet. Every individual should have equal opportunity to have resources learn and grow.

# What is your project?
___ is a web application which acts as community driven page to create and share new and amazing roadmaps...

# What does it do?
Our project gives access to all the users to create there own roadmap and courses. There are various resources in the market to be accessed by people who want to gain knowledge but many times user gets confused in selecting the right course for their learning. We have given a method for each and every user to create their own course or roadmap or even grab and fork someone's roadmap.

Each roadmap contains subtopics and a check list to create a list of resources and insert links and description on how to study them.
Every roadmap can be starred (if user like it) and forked (if user wants to follow it). 

Each user will have their own dashboard to see their progress, current projects and completed projects.
